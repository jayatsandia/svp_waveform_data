These are results from voltage and frequency ride-through experiments. The .wfm files are tab delineated files that can be read by excel or python easily. 

F90 means it was a FRT test with the frequency set to 90% of nominal. 
V110 means it was a VRT test with voltage set to 110% of nominal. 

The sampling rate is included in the files along with a unique timestamp.
